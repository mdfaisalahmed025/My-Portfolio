        <h3>Metro Rail Management System</h3>
        <p>We have created a web-based Train Ticket Management System based on the latest Metro Rail Project in Dhaka. Our target is
        to create a reliable and fast experience for all the Metro Rail passengers, Taking a step ahead towards the visionary
        project of Digital Bangladesh. Our web-based application is fully functional with some very minor bugs and it is
        visually pleasing. It was built intending to have two kinds of users not just the passengers but also the trainmasters.
        Our webApp has bunch of functionalities that makes the lives of both passengers and trainmasters much easier as it makes
        their experience fluid and reduces their daily hassles. Passengers no longer need to stand in a line to wait for to buy
        tickets. They can now buy tickets online through our app very easily and that’s not all. Passenger doesn’t need to carry
        a physical ticket either as we’ve implemented a very useful digital ticket feature which has QR Code implemented that
        can be downloaded in the passenger’s phone right after the payment.
