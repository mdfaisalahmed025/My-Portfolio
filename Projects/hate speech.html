        <h3>Bangla Hate Speech Detection</h3>
        <p> In this work, we have made our custom dataset and used some labeled
            data from the previous open access dataset. Both were merged together and implemented in this project. We
            have used
            around 4,978 data for prepossessing and running the code. The labeled datasets were categorized into four
            distinct
            classes, i.e., geopolitical, personal, religion, gender abusive and non-hates. This work uses traditional
            classifiers,
            deep learning, transfer learning-based classifiers, or a mix of both types of classifiers to detect hate
            speech. Deep
            learning is a sort of machine learning that uses data to learn. It may be used to search for patterns in
            data. Transfer
            learning is a machine learning that allows a machine-learning algorithm to learn from data that another
            machine learning
            algorithm has already learned. Pretrained approaches have significantly advanced machine learning and
            natural language
            processing disciplines, including hate speech identification. These methods were used to identify hate
            speech. However,
            we also used Google API to convert text from Bangla to English. After that the emojis were removed from the
            data-sets
            and again that datas were converted back to Bangla. Finally, we have got the results where the best accuracy
            is in GRU
            and Attention model which is 98% . However, the lowest accuracy weâ€™ve got in BERT model is 94% for this
            research.
